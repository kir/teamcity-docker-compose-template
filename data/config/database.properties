# This is a sample file for configuring TeamCity to use an external database.
# To make it effective, copy it to the "database.properties" file and modify the settings
# according to your environment.
# Do not modify this file, it will be overwritten on the TeamCity server start-up.
# See documentation at https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD18/Setting+up+an+External+Database

# Database: PostgreSQL  

connectionUrl=jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/buildserver
connectionProperties.user=test
connectionProperties.password=test

# The maximum number of connections TeamCity can open on database server.
maxConnections=50

# Specifies whether TeamCity should check each jdbc connection before use.
# It reduces the system performance but avoids cases when the system uses
# a connection that was closed by the database server due to a time-out or this
# connection was broken during the previous operation.
